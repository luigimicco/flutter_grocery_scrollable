## Key points

 - Three main categories of widgets are: structure and navigation; displaying information; and, positioning widgets.
 - There are two main visual design systems available in Flutter, **Material** and **Cupertino**. They help you build apps that look native on Android and iOS, respectively.
 - Using the **Material** theme, you can build quite varied user interface elements to give your app a custom look and feel.
 - It’s generally a good idea to establish a common theme object for your app, giving you a single source of truth for your app’s style.
 - The **Scaffold** widget implements all your basic visual layout structure needs.
 - The **Container** widget can be used to group other widgets together.
 - The **Stack** widget layers child widgets on top of each other.
 - Flutter maintains three trees in parallel: the **Widget**, **Element** and **RenderObject** trees.
 - A Flutter app is performant because it maintains its structure and only updates the widgets that need redrawing.
 - The **Flutter Inspector** is a useful tool to debug, experiment with and inspect a widget tree.
 - You should always start by creating **StatelessWidgets** and only use **StatefulWidgets** when you need to manage and maintain the state of your widget.
 - Inherited widgets are a good solution to access state from the top of the tree.
 - **ListView** and **GridView** support both horizontal and vertical scroll directions.
 - The **primary** property lets Flutter know which scroll view is the primary scroll view.
 - **physics** in a scroll view lets you change the user scroll interaction.
 - Especially in a **nested list view**, remember to set shrinkWrap to true so you can give the scroll view a fixed height for all the items in the list.
 - Use a **FutureBuilder** to wait for an asynchronous task to complete.
 - You can nest scrollable widgets. For example, you can place a grid view within a list view. Unleash your wildest imagination!
 - Use **ScrollController** and **ScrollNotification** to control or listen to scroll behavior.
 - **Barrel** files are handy to group imports together. They also let you import many widgets using a single file.
 - You can pass data around with **callbacks** or **provider packages**.
 - If you need to pass data one level up, use **callbacks**.
 - If you need to pass data deep in the widget tree, use **providers**.
 - **Provider** is a state management helper that acts as a wrapper around inherited widgets.
 - **Provider** helps expose state model objects to widgets below it.
 - **Consumer** listens for changes to values and rebuilds the widgets below itself.
 - Split your widgets by screen to keep code modular and organized.
 - Create **manager** objects to manage functions and state changes in one place.
 - Gesture widgets recognize and determine the type of touch event. They provide callbacks to react to events like **onTap** or **onDrag**.
 - You can use dismissible widgets to swipe away items in a list.
