# Fooderlich scrollable

## Key points
 - **ListView** and **GridView** support both horizontal and vertical scroll directions.
 - The **primary** property lets Flutter know which scroll view is the primary scroll view.
 - **physics** in a scroll view lets you change the user scroll interaction.
 - Especially in a **nested list view**, remember to set shrinkWrap to true so you can give the scroll view a fixed height for all the items in the list.
 - Use a **FutureBuilder** to wait for an asynchronous task to complete.
 - You can nest scrollable widgets. For example, you can place a grid view within a list view. Unleash your wildest imagination!
 - Use **ScrollController** and **ScrollNotification** to control or listen to scroll behavior.
 - **Barrel** files are handy to group imports together. They also let you import many widgets using a single file.
